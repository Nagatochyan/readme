## Operate Module
Sussy free version only has joiner and spammer!  
If you want more features, buy the paid version, you poor bastaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaard
### Proxy and Token Settings 
Basically, SussyRaider loads the proxy first, then the token.  
As shown in the screenshot, select the type of proxy you want to use, check `Use Proxy`, check the proxy, and finally load the token.

[:warning:] It is possible to use SussyRaider without proxies  
But there's almost no situation where you don't have to use because your IP is persecuted (rate limit) or identified as black (marked)  
Some idiot is currently being persecuted for spamming without a proxy. It's pathetic. I think he should die
